Constraints.title=Constraints
Constraints.description=The constraints precise which task can be executed on the given core.
Constraints.coreSelectionTooltip=Select the core to edit its constraints
Timings.title=Timings
Timings.description=The timings associate to each couple (core definition, task) the time needed to execute the task on the core.
Timings.coreSelectionTooltip=Select the core to edit its timings

Timings.timingExport.dialog=Enter the name of a new excel file
Constraints.file=Constraints file path
Constraints.fileDescription=Enter a excel file path that contains timings with task names as rows and operator definitions as columns. Operators with timings will be automatically added to the constraints while operators without timings will be removed from the constraints.

Simulation.title=Simulation
Simulation.mainOperator.title=Main core selection
Simulation.mainOperator.description=Select the core that will be used as main core. The mapping always starts with an homogeneous simulation: the algorithm is simulated on an imaginary architecture with an infinite number of cores with the same type as the main core. The mapping will be better if the main core is chosen to be the one which necessitates the best optimization.
Simulation.mainOperatorSelectionTooltip=Select the main core
Simulation.mainMedium.title=Main medium selection
Simulation.mainMedium.description=Select the medium that will be used as main medium. The mapping always starts with an homogeneous simulation: the algorithm is simulated on an imaginary architecture with an infinite number of cores totally connected by media with the type selected here. The mapping will be better if the main medium is chosen to be the one which necessitates the best optimization.
Simulation.mainMediumSelectionTooltip=Select the main medium
Simulation.DataTypes.title=Edit data types
Simulation.DataTypes.description=Set the data type sizes in base unit (usually byte). These sizes will be used for deployment simulations.
Simulation.DataTypes.typeColumn=Data type
Simulation.DataTypes.sizeColumn=Size
Simulation.DataTypes.dialog.title=Change data type size
Simulation.DataTypes.dialog.message=Enter a new size for data type: 
Simulation.DataTypes.addType=Add data type
Simulation.DataTypes.removeType=Remove data type
Simulation.DataAverageSize.title=Edit average transfer size
Simulation.DataAverageSize.description=Set the average transfer size sizes in base unit (usually byte). This size is used while calculating the routing table. The routes between operators are static and will be optimized for the given data size.
Simulation.SpecialVertex.title=Select the cores to execute broadcasts/explode/implode
Simulation.SpecialVertex.description=Be careful: a broadcasts/explode/implode can only be mapped on either its predecessors cores or its successors cores. Do not reduce excessively the core capabilities to broadcasts/explode/implode or errors will appear during mapping. Selecting no core to execute broadcasts/implode/explode actually selects them all.
