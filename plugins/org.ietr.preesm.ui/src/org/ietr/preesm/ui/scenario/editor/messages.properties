Constraints.title=Constraints
Constraints.description=The constraints precise which task can be executed on the given operator.
Constraints.coreSelectionTooltip=Select the operator to edit its constraints
RelativeConstraints.title=Relative Constraints
RelativeConstraints.description=The relative constraints can associate each actor to a group given by a number. All instances of actors of a given group are mapped on the same operator. -1 means that no group is selected. Associating one actor alone to a group ensures that all its occurences share a same processor.
RelativeConstraints.taskColumn=Task name
RelativeConstraints.constraintColumn=group ID
RelativeConstraints.dialog.title=Change relative constraints
RelativeConstraints.dialog.message=Enter a new relative constraint for task: 
RelativeConstraints.file=Relative constraints file path
RelativeConstraints.fileDescription=Enter a excel file path that contains relative constraints with task names as rows and an attribute rel_con_i with i an integer.

Timings.coreSelectionTooltip=Select the operator to edit its timings
Timings.taskColumn=Task name
Timings.timeColumn=Time
Timings.dialog.title=Change timing
Timings.dialog.message=Enter a new timing for task:

Constraints.file=Constraints file path
Constraints.fileDescription=Enter a excel file path that contains timings with task names as rows and operator definitions as columns. Operators with timings will be automatically added to the constraints while operators without timings will be removed from the constraints.
Constraints.fileEdit=Edit file
Constraints.fileBrowseTitle=Select a timing excel file to import constraints from
Simulation.title=Simulation
Simulation.mainOperator.title=Main operator selection
Simulation.mainOperator.description=Select the operator that will be used as main operator. The mapping always starts with an homogeneous simulation: the algorithm is simulated on an imaginary architecture with an infinite number of operators with the same type as the main operator. The mapping will be better if the main operator is chosen to be the one which necessitates the best optimization.
Simulation.mainOperatorSelectionTooltip=Select the main operator
Simulation.mainMedium.title=Main ComNode selection
Simulation.mainMedium.description=Select the ComNode that will be used as main ComNode. The mapping always starts with an homogeneous simulation: the algorithm is simulated on an imaginary architecture with an infinite number of operators totally connected by media with the type selected here. The mapping will be better if the main ComNode is chosen to be the one which necessitates the best optimization.
Simulation.mainMediumSelectionTooltip=Select the main ComNode
Simulation.DataTypes.title=Edit data types
Simulation.DataTypes.description=Set the data type sizes in base unit (usually byte). These sizes will be used for deployment simulations.

Simulation.DataTypes.dialog.title=Change data type size
Simulation.DataTypes.dialog.message=Enter a new size for data type: 
Simulation.DataTypes.addType=Add data type
Simulation.DataTypes.removeType=Remove data type
Simulation.DataAverageSize.title=Edit average transfer size
Simulation.DataAverageSize.description=Set the average transfer size sizes in base unit (usually byte). This size is used while calculating the routing table. The routes between operators are static and will be optimized for the given data size.
Simulation.SpecialVertex.title=Select the operators to execute broadcasts/explode/implode
Simulation.SpecialVertex.description=Be careful: a broadcasts/explode/implode can only be mapped on either its predecessors operators or its successors operators. Do not reduce excessively the operator capabilities to broadcasts/explode/implode or errors will appear during mapping. Selecting no operator to execute broadcasts/implode/explode actually selects them all.
